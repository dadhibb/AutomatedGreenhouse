# AutomatedGreenhouse
Automated greenhouse project
Hello,
I'm looking for anyone who has successfully made a simple greenhouse automation system using an Arduino Mega 2560.
I'm leaning towards an off-grid system because I don't want to have to connect it to the house.
I have various bints 'n bobs lying around:
- Arduino Mega 2560
- LM-393 & sensors, I was thinking I'd need 5 in total
- 4-relay board for : (1) Aquarium pump for watering system (2) Heater (3) Fan (4) Light / spare
- Wemos board, Huzzah feather, various ESP8266s (I'd like to connect to my Thingspeak channel)
- Blynk account & smartphone App
Things I don't yet have:
12v 80Ah boat battery, solar panel, charge controller
Nice clean code that will monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture and initiate the right actions (turn on heater / open window & start fan ; turn on/off watering system according to LM-393 values) etc.
I guess this must be out there somewhere...
Cheers!
